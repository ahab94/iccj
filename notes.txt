Bumped version to 1.0.3-SNAPSHOT: ~/bin/changeMavenVersion.bash

Can the "IOTA client download link" and the " IOTA Client Download Filename" be merged into one entry? I think it might be a bit confusing for people when they want to update the download source to devide the link into two separate entries. That would be great.

icc.properties:
Dropped iotaDownloadFilename
Changed iotaDownloadLink=http://188.138.57.93/IRI-1.1.1.1.jar

Messages:
Dropped fieldLabelIotaDownloadFilename and fieldLabelIotaDownloadFilenameTooltip

Changed:
fieldLabelIotaDownloadLink=IOTA Client Download Link
fieldLabelIotaDownloadLinkTooltip=URL of location and IRI version to download new IOTA application library

Make iccj settings dialog wider

checked in

A real minor thing, and only if its no extra work. Maybe the disconnect status icon can made a bit smaller?

The "Seen Transaction:" metrics are not that important. So if its not that easy to implement you can remove it and we will continue without

Fix IRI log loading:

New button control bar on IOTA Log dialog

new control bar:

d    pausePressed
d    pauseUnpressed

d head  more   tail play pause
      +           >    ||

      lastFilePosition=0 or last value from server
      numLines=500

d response obj:
      support new LogLinesResponse

if head => stop timer
if head more => get next 500
repeated query:

      if pause top timer



New message text:

bumped to 1.0.4-SNAPSHOT

---------------
Wed: 12/21/2016

Issues:
d 1) A1 fix log viewer issues:

a) When viewing the "tail" in the log it shows all transactions except of the top 10 lines lines of the log, which probably wasn't intended to be like that.

b) when the log refreshing is activated it will get for each refreshing the entire log (minus top 10 lines) and add it below the previously fetched log. Which leads to many copys of almost the same log being displayed in the IOTA Log console. And logically it gets very leggy as it refreshes, due to getting almost the entire log.

c) And when switching to "head" view, it actually displayed the same log part as when viewing the "tail".

2) A2 Updated nbr format from iri:
In the coming days there will be a update in the IRI to the getNeighbors API call, which will remove the "/" from the API return message. When that update is released, there needs to be a small change in the ICCR handling of the getNeighborInfo API call, to be compatible again.

What I am talking about is this: Current IRI API output "address": "/82.241.71.230:14265" 
And new output format will be: "address": "82.241.71.230:14265"

d 3) B1 If a server is not actively open in the ICCJ, its not possible to remove a server by clicking "Close or Remove Selected" in the "Manage Servers" window.

d 4) B2 When changing the IOTA Port to a custom port number, ICCJ will not be able to get the Neighbors and node info any more. This means that the localhost port number the ICCR uses to make the API calls to the IRI needs to be a variable equal to the user defined port number.
In my last email, regarding version 1.0.2 I sad it would be best if we removed the "IOTA Port" Input field, so that the port number would just be included in the "IOTA Start Command" Input field. But as this issue shows, we probably need the "IOTA Port" Input field to stay, to set the port variable for the API calls...
What are your thoughts on this?

d 5) B3 When changing the ICCR port number, it requires the ICCR to restart for changes to take affect. Can the ICCR restart command be invoked on change of the ICCR port number?
Else, a message notifying the user that a restart of ICCR is required for ICCR port changes to take affect would be good.


done:
Fixed B1 issue with removing ICCR server config.

---------------
Thu: 12/22/2016

done:
B3 changing iccr port number, requires an iccr restart:
New REST api: added IccrService:doIccrAction
Updated HttpProxy: doIccrAction
New ServerProxy:doIccrAction
Detect when ICCR Port changes and prompt user for restart
Update iccj server configuration
Server controller new doRestartIccr method
New Constants.ICCR_ACTION_RESTART
New RestartIccrWorker
? Show spinner

On svr ctlr iccr prop changes, mirror those changes to ctlr iccrProps
On main ctlr manage server changes, mirror those changes to ctlr serverProps

done
Two ways that ICCR server port is changed
1) Relative to the ICC UI, changing the ICCR server properties:
Main menu -> Servers -> Manager -> <select server name> -> Edit
Change the ICCR Port

if server open:
Check for iota port conflict
Check for iccr port change
Call same method as used by ctlr initiated change to prompt user


done:
2) Relative to the ICCR server, changing the ICCR port property on the server:
         Selected server tab  -> Settings
         Change the ICCR Port
Check for iota port conflict
Pushes a prop change to server, detects change, prompt user to send iccr restart, sends iccr restart
Change ICC server prop in UI settings before prompting user for iccr restart
If user agrees to restart:
- if refresh in progress, stop
- first issue restart cmd
- then change http proxy with new port
- if refresh was in progress, start


New Message localization strings:
restartIccrActionError=Restart ICCR call failed
iccrPortNumberChangePromptTitle=ICCR Port Number Change: Restart Required
iccrPortNumberChangePrompt=The ICCR port number was changed, do you want to restart that ICCR now?
restartIccrActionError=Restart ICCR call failed
consoleLogIccrIsRestarted=ICCR was successfully restarted
consoleLogIccrNotRestarted=ICCR was not restarted
dialogSaveErrorPortNumberConflict=The ICCR port number conflicts with the IOTA port number

But as this issue shows, we probably need the "IOTA Port" Input field to stay, to set the port variable for the API calls...

Suggested we leave as is, iota port num as separate variable

d A1
a) When viewing the "tail" in the log it shows all transactions except of the top 10 lines lines of the log, which probably wasn't intended to be like that.

questions:
ICC Settings: time for icc to refresh nbrs status being 90 seconds is to display the server tab's neighbors table?
ICC Settings: time for icc to refresh node info is for updating what, the footer and just a health and status check?

What is online in footer?

Remove selected is remove from server tab panel as well as delete server configuration? Right now it prompts...
