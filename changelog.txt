Version 1.0.3

Delivered Sunday 12/18/2016

1) Fixed IRI log file loading time issues:
Previously the entire IRI log file was being loaded leading to long load times.
Now there is a new control bar on IOTA Log dialog that supports:
a) Viewing the end of the IOTA log file contents "tail" with automatic refresh and pause;
b) Viewing the beginning of the IOTA log file contents "head" with button to display more.
c) The initial default when the IOTA log file dialog is displayed is the tail with automatic refresh as new lines are added to the IOTA IRI log file.

2) Added a new icon to the footer status indicator to indicate when the ICC is not connected to the ICCR: a question mark icon.

3) Removed the Start Wallet server button from the server panel.

4) Fixed the issues with saving neighbor table entries:
a) Added error checking for duplicate neighbor ID values.
b) Added error checking for duplicate neighbor URI values.
c) Fixed when the neighbor table save button is enabled: only after user has done add, remove, and or neighbor edit operations.


5) Added an "in-progress" loading spinner icon for while the potentially long runnning install iota operation is in progress.

6) The above changes resulted the following changes to the MessagesBundle language localization property files:
dialogIotaLogDirectionTooltip=Select the direction (head or tail) to show IOTA log file lines
dialogIotaLogTail=Tail
dialogIotaLogHead=Head
dialogIotaLogTailTooltip=Show IOTA log lines from the tail of the IOTA log file

neighborTableDuplicateNbrIdError=That neighbor ID already exists
neighborTableDuplicateNbrError=That neighbor already exists

Version 1.0.4
Delivered Friday 12/23/2016

Fixed A1 IOTA log viewer issues. The following behavior is supported:
a) When the dialog first opens up, it will attempt to load last 250 lines from the IOTA log file.
b) As the IOTA log file changes, new lines will be added in the UI.
c) When the IOTA log file head direction is requested, the first 250 lines will be loaded from the top of the IOTA log file.
d) When the IOTA log file head add button is clicked, the next 250 lines will be loaded from the top of the IOTA log file.
e) There will only ever be a max of 500 log file lines displayed in the UI IOTA log file viewer, as new lines are loaded, older lines will be removed to insure the viewer does not grow too large.

Addressed A2 suport for new IRI getNeighbors result format with no leading "/"

Fixed B1 issue, now possible to remove a server by clicking "Close or Remove Selected" in the "Manage Servers" window.

Fixed B3 issue, with two ways that ICCR server port is changed, the user will be prompted to send a restart command to ICCR
1) Relative to the ICC UI, changing the ICCR server properties:
   Main menu -> Servers -> Manager -> <select server name> -> Edit

2) Relative to the ICCR server, changing the ICCR port property on the server:
   Selected server tab  -> Settings

Added checking for conflicts with the IOTA port when changing the ICCR port number.

Added checking for conflicts with existing ICCR server IP and hostnames when changing an ICCR IP or hostname.

Added alert to not allow the user to change an ICCR server IP or hostname when that ICCR server is open.

Added the three new ICC 20x20, 40x40, and 512x512 icons.

New Message localization strings:
restartIccrActionError=Restart ICCR call failed
iccrPortNumberChangePromptTitle=ICCR Port Number Change: Restart Required
iccrPortNumberChangePrompt=The ICCR port number was changed, do you want to restart that ICCR now?
restartIccrActionError=Restart ICCR call failed
consoleLogIccrIsRestarted=ICCR was successfully restarted
consoleLogIccrNotRestarted=ICCR was not restarted
dialogSaveErrorPortNumberConflict=The ICCR port number conflicts with the IOTA port number
consoleLogReconnecting=Reconnecting...
dialogSaveErrorServerIpTaken=server IP or hostname is already in use
dialogSaveErrorIpServerOpen=You can not change the ICCR IP or hostname when the server is open

Fixed issue where the iota neighbors were sometimes not being added to IRI when iccr was told to start IOTA. The workaround would be to do a save of neighbors from the ICC UI to add neighbors. The problem was that sometimes the IRI would take a longer time than expected to spin up.

ICCR pkg archive installation notes:
1) Download iccr-pkg-1.0.6.tgz

2) Copy the archive to a tmp directory:
   mkdir /tmp/iccr-pkg
   cd /tmp/iccr-pkg
   cp ~/Downloads/iccr-pkg-1.0.6.tgz /tmp/iccr-pkg

3) Extract the package archive:
   tar -xzf iccr-pkg-1.0.6.tgz

4) For a first time install, run the install-iccr.bash script:
   ./install-iccr.bash

5) To update an existing ICCR installation without overwriting the existing configuration files, run the patch-iccr.bash script:
    /opt/iccr/bin/iccr-ctl stop
    ./patch-iccr.bash
    /opt/iccr/bin/iccr-ctl start


ICCJ zip archive first time installation notes:
1) Decide where you want to install the ICC, into /opt for example

2) cd to the dir that you want to install ICC into:
cd /opt

3) Unzip the ICC:
unzip ~/Downloads/iccj-1.0.6.zip

4) Start the ICC:
/opt/icc/bin/icc


ICCJ patch notes, how to update an existing ICC installation without losing the existing property files:
This assumes the ICC is installed in /opt

1) Make a backup dir:
mkdir /tmp/icc-props

2) Copy the existing property files
cp /opt/icc/conf/*properties /tmp/icc-props

3) cd to the dir that contains the existing ICC dir:
cd /opt

4) Unzip over on top of the existing icc dir (answer A for overwrite all):
unzip ~/Downloads/iccj-1.0.6.zip

5) Restore the previous property files:
cp -f /tmp/icc-props/* /opt/icc/conf/

Note that this 1.0.6 release has new default values for the following properties in the ICCJ icc.properties file:
iotaDownloadLink=http://85.93.93.110/IRI-1.1.2.3.jar
refreshNeighborsTime=10
refreshNodeInfoTime=60

6) Start the ICC:
/opt/icc/bin/icc
