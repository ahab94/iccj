Version 1.0.3

Delivered Sunday 12/18/2016

1) Fixed IRI log file loading time issues:
Previously the entire IRI log file was being loaded leading to long load times.
Now there is a new control bar on IOTA Log dialog that supports:
a) Viewing the end of the IOTA log file contents "tail" with automatic refresh and pause;
b) Viewing the beginning of the IOTA log file contents "head" with button to display more.
c) The initial default when the IOTA log file dialog is displayed is the tail with automatic refresh as new lines are added to the IOTA IRI log file.

2) Added a new icon to the footer status indicator to indicate when the ICC is not connected to the ICCR: a question mark icon.

3) Removed the Start Wallet server button from the server panel.

4) Fixed the issues with saving neighbor table entries:
a) Added error checking for duplicate neighbor ID values.
b) Added error checking for duplicate neighbor URI values.
c) Fixed when the neighbor table save button is enabled: only after user has done add, remove, and or neighbor edit operations.


5) Added an "in-progress" loading spinner icon for while the potentially long runnning install iota operation is in progress.

dialogIotaLogTailTooltip=Show IOTA log lines from the tail of the IOTA log file
